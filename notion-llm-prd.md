# Product Requirements Document: Notion Comment AI Assistant

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The Notion Comment AI Assistant is a Flask-based web application designed to monitor Notion pages for new comments, process these comments using a Large Language Model (LLM), and automatically respond in the same comment thread with relevant information or assistance.

### 1.2 Product Overview
This application bridges Notion's collaborative workspace with AI capabilities, enabling automated responses to user queries or comments without requiring users to leave the Notion environment. It serves as an embedded AI assistant that works within existing Notion workflows.

### 1.3 Scope
- In-scope: Monitoring Notion pages, processing comments with an LLM, posting responses
- Out-of-scope: Content creation, document editing, database management in Notion

## 2. Product Features

### 2.1 Core Features

#### 2.1.1 Notion Integration
- Poll specified Notion pages at regular intervals to check for new comments
- Authenticate with Notion API using secure token management
- Differentiate between previously processed and new comments
- Extract comment text, metadata, and thread context

#### 2.1.2 LLM Processing
- Send comment text as a query to a configured LLM API
- Include relevant context from the comment thread in the LLM prompt
- Process LLM response for appropriate formatting
- Handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully

#### 2.1.3 Response Posting
- Post LLM-generated responses as replies in the original comment thread
- Maintain appropriate attribution (e.g., "AI Assistant:")
- Handle Unicode characters and markdown formatting correctly

### 2.2 Administration Features

#### 2.2.1 Configuration Management
- Configure which Notion pages to monitor
- Set polling frequency
- Specify LLM model parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
- Configure authentication credentials securely

#### 2.2.2 Monitoring and Logging
- Log all activities including comment detection, LLM queries, and responses
- Track error rates and response times
- Provide basic usage statistics

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Development Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Technology Stack
- Backend: Flask (Python web framework)
- Database: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- API Integrations: Notion API, LLM provider API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Hosting: Docker container compatible with cloud hosting services
- Authentication: Environment variables and secure credential storage

#### 3.1.2 API Requirements
- Notion API: Integration for comment retrieval and posting
- LLM API: Integration for processing comment text and generating responses
- Error handling for both APIs with appropriate retry mechanisms

### 3.2 Security Requirements
- Secure storage of API keys and tokens
- No storage of actual comment content beyond processing
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization

### 3.3 Performance Requirements
- Response time: < 30 seconds from comment posting to AI response
- Scalability: Support for monitoring multiple pages simultaneously
- Reliability: 99.5% uptime
- Resource efficiency: Minimal CPU and memory footprint

## 4. User Experience

### 4.1 Target Users
- Notion workspace administrators
- Team members using Notion for collaboration
- Support staff responding to internal or external queries

### 4.2 User Interaction Flow
1. Administrator configures the application to monitor specific Notion pages
2. Users post comments on monitored Notion pages
3. Application detects new comments during polling cycles
4. Comment text is processed by the LLM
5. AI response is posted as a reply in the same thread
6. Users continue the conversation naturally, with AI responding as needed

## 5. Implementation Plan
